# ðŸ§— Room: Summit

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective
Test your knowledge of the frameworks learned: Cyber Kill Chain, MITRE ATT&CK, Unified Kill Chain, and the Diamond Model.

---

## ðŸ§  What I Practiced

- Mapped alerts to appropriate frameworks.
- Compared frameworks based on use cases:
  - Kill Chain = good for early detection
  - MITRE = detailed behavioral analysis
  - Unified Kill Chain = end-to-end APT mapping
  - Diamond Model = attribution and investigation

---

## ðŸ“˜ Summary

- Each framework has strengths.
- Using them together gives broader visibility.
- Detection engineers and threat hunters benefit most from layering models.
