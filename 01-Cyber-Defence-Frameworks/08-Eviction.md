# 🚪 Room: Eviction

## 🎯 Objective
Learn how and when to evict an attacker from a compromised system or network, and why timing and planning matter.

---

## 📘 Key Concepts

- **Eviction** = Removing an attacker from a compromised system
- Must be coordinated to prevent tipping off the attacker
- Often part of an **Incident Response (IR)** plan

---

## 🔍 Best Practices

- Don’t act until you understand the full scope of the breach
- Always preserve evidence (logs, memory, etc.)
- Wait until you can simultaneously **cut off access across all systems**
- Communicate across SOC, IR, and legal/compliance teams

---

## 🧠 What I Learned

- Premature eviction can cause attackers to change tactics and reenter undetected
- Ideal time to evict is **when you have full control over endpoints and infrastructure**
- Logs and forensics are essential both before and after eviction
