# 💎 Room: Diamond Model

## 🎯 Objective
Understand the Diamond Model of Intrusion Analysis, which provides a structured way to analyze cyber threats using four interrelated elements.

---

## 🔷 Core Elements

1. **Adversary** – Who is conducting the attack
2. **Infrastructure** – What tools/systems they use (C2 servers, malware delivery)
3. **Capability** – What they can do (exploit techniques, tools)
4. **Victim** – The entity being targeted

---

## 🔍 Purpose

- Designed for **threat intelligence and analysis**
- Shows how each element connects to the others
- Helps track, profile, and understand threat actors

---

## 🧠 What I Learned

- Mapping threats with the diamond model helps reveal hidden relationships.
- Infrastructure is often reused by attackers — pivoting on it can expose other victims or campaigns.
- Every intrusion has these four parts, whether known or unknown.

---

## 📝 Notes

- Pairs well with MITRE ATT&CK for tactical analysis.
- Helps analysts understand the **why and how** behind attacks.
