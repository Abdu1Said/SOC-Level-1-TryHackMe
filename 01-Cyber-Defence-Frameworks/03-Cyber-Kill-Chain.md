# 🎯 Room: Cyber Kill Chain

## 🔍 Objective
Understand the Lockheed Martin Cyber Kill Chain model and how it helps track the attacker’s path in a structured way.

## 🔗 Kill Chain Stages

1. **Reconnaissance** – Gather intel on the target (emails, IPs, software).
2. **Weaponization** – Pair exploit with payload (e.g., malware).
3. **Delivery** – Send the payload (e.g., phishing, USB).
4. **Exploitation** – Payload activates and exploits vulnerability.
5. **Installation** – Malware installs on the system.
6. **Command & Control (C2)** – Remote control established.
7. **Actions on Objectives** – Data theft, encryption, sabotage.

## 🧠 What I Learned

- Detection is more effective at early stages (recon, delivery).
- Most breaches start with phishing (delivery).
- SOC tools should map alerts to Kill Chain stages.
