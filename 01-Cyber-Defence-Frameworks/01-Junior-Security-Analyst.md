# 🧑‍💻 Room: Junior Security Analyst Intro

## 🎯 Objective
Understand the role and responsibilities of a Junior Security Analyst in a real-world Security Operations Center (SOC).

---

## 📘 Key Concepts

- Tier 1 SOC analysts are the front line — they monitor alerts, investigate incidents, and escalate when necessary.
- Common tools include: SIEM (e.g., Splunk), ticketing systems, log analyzers, and threat intelligence platforms.
- Analysts often work in shifts to provide 24/7 coverage.

---

## 🧠 What I Learned

- Junior analysts don't solve everything — their job is to triage alerts and escalate confirmed threats.
- Not every alert means something bad. Analysts need to think critically and recognize false positives.
- Clear communication and documentation is essential for teamwork across tiers.

---

## 🧪 Hands-On Practice

- Identified fake alerts and confirmed valid ones.
- Logged findings and recommended escalation for suspicious events.
- Explored a ticketing system interface similar to real SOCs.

---

## 📝 Notes

- A strong SOC uses playbooks to respond to common incidents.
- Building muscle memory with logs and tools is key to becoming fast and effective.
