# Room: Junior Security Analyst Intro

## üéØ Objective
Understand the role, responsibilities, and environment of a Junior Security Analyst in a Security Operations Center (SOC), and simulate real-world scenarios including alert triage, investigation, and escalation.

---

## ‚úÖ Task 1: Introduction to the Role

### üîπ Role Title
**Triage Specialist** ‚Äì A Junior Security Analyst primarily reviews alerts and determines whether they are false positives or actual threats requiring escalation.

---

## ‚úÖ Task 2: What is a SOC?

A Security Operations Center (SOC) is responsible for:
- Monitoring and protecting organizational assets (e.g., data, systems, IP)
- Preventing, detecting, and responding to cyber threats 24/7
- Using tools like SIEM, IDS, IPS, EDR, and threat intelligence feeds
- Following structured workflows across Preparation, Detection, and Response

### üîç SOC Responsibilities Breakdown:
- **Preparation & Prevention**: Updating firewalls, signatures, patching, gathering intel
- **Monitoring & Investigation**: Using SIEM/EDR, prioritizing alerts (Critical ‚Üí Low)
- **Response**: Isolate infected hosts, kill malicious processes, delete artifacts

No flag was required for this task.

## ‚úÖ Task 3: Simulated SOC Workflow

### üîç Scenario:
An SSH brute-force attack occurred and succeeded.
