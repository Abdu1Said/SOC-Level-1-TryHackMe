# 🔗 Room: Unified Kill Chain

## 🎯 Objective
Understand how the Unified Kill Chain combines various frameworks like MITRE ATT&CK and Lockheed Martin’s Kill Chain to give better coverage of attacker behavior.

---

## 🧠 Key Concepts

- Developed to bridge gaps in existing models (Cyber Kill Chain & MITRE).
- Covers **3 main phases**:
  - Pre-Attack
  - Initial Intrusion
  - Post-Exploitation

---

## 🔍 Features

- Includes 18 total phases to represent a full adversary campaign.
- Helps blue teams design better detection logic.
- Aligns with attacker behavior across APT campaigns.

---

## 📘 Use Cases

- Red teamers use it to simulate entire campaigns.
- Blue teamers use it to detect persistence and data exfiltration phases.
- SOCs map alerts to Unified Kill Chain phases for deeper insight.

---

## 📝 Notes

- Think of it as a fusion of **MITRE** and **Cyber Kill Chain** with additional context.
- Promotes complete visibility and layered defense.
