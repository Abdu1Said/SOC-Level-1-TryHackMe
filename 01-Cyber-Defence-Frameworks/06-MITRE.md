# 🧠 Room: MITRE ATT&CK Framework

## 🎯 Objective
Understand the structure and purpose of the MITRE ATT&CK Framework, which helps organizations identify and respond to attacker behavior.

---

## 📘 Key Concepts

- **ATT&CK = Adversarial Tactics, Techniques, and Common Knowledge**
- Organizes how attackers behave post-compromise
- Used for detection, red teaming, and threat hunting

---

## 🧱 Structure

- **Tactics**: The “why” — goals (e.g. Initial Access, Privilege Escalation)
- **Techniques**: The “how” — methods used to achieve tactics
- **Sub-techniques**: More specific breakdowns of techniques
- **Mitigations & Detection**: Defense strategies mapped to each

---

## 🔍 Practical Use

- Used by SOCs to align detection rules and alerts
- Helps track real-world APT behaviors
- Maps well to SIEM and EDR solutions

---

## 🧠 What I Learned

- ATT&CK is constantly updated with new TTPs
- It’s important to understand the difference between tactics and techniques
- Can be used to build detection coverage matrices
